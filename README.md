# data tool for merging expression data, pathway data and subtypes data
 
This is a simple project to process data in biological information.
## Getting Started

Please install `Pandas`. 

Then you should change the file names 
in the corresponding lines. 

You should at least have three files: expression file, pathway file and
subtypes file.

Simply, run `run.py` to get the merging files.

Finally, we could get the expression files whose genes were in pathway 
data named by subtypes.

Let's Try.
